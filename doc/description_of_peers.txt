HOST CACHE - Maintains a list of connected peers.
* Supplies a list networked Super Peer IDs.
* Registers a Peer on the network.

PEER
* Joins the network by registering with the Host Cache.
* Requests the Super Peer for a shared file.
* Simulates transferal of a file from/to another Peer.

  NORMAL PEER
  * Connects to one Super Peer from a list of IDs given by the Host Cache.
  * Gives the Super Peer its list of shared files.
  * Connects to another Super Peer in the event of disconnection.

  SUPER PEER
  * Can be connected to by other Peers.
  * Connects to several Super Peers from a list of IDs given by the Host Cache.
  * Maintains a list of shared files for each connected Normal Peer.
  * Responds to requests by searching it's list of shared files.
  * Follows the document-request-model to forward requests for files it does not have.


ORDINARY PEER BEHAVIOUR
* Send Connect
* Send file list
* Request file
* Send file

SUPER PEER BEHAVIOUR < ORDINARY PEER BEHAVIOUR
* Receive connection
* Receive file list
* Receive search request


CONNECT (SUPER, ORDINARY)
  if (myAgent.notRegistered()) {
    // send request_register message to host cache
    // wait for registration successful message
  }
  until (myAgent.peerCount() >= myAgent.MIN_NEIGHBOURS) {
    if (myAgent.peerList().empty()) {
      // ask host cache for neighbours
      // wait for neighbours message
      // assign list of neighbours from message payload
    }
    // send request_connection to the next peer in the list
    // wait for connection_response message from that peer
    // if message fail, next()
    // else_if message success, add peer to list of connected peers.
  }
  myAgent.setConnected(true);

SEND FILE LIST (ORDINARY)
  if (myAgent.peerCount() == 0) {
    myAgent.setNeedsToSendFiles(true);
  }
  if (myAgent.isConnected() && myAgent.needsToSendFiles())
    // send files_list message to connected peer.
    myAgent.setNeedsToSendFiles(false);
  }

REQUEST FILE (SUPER, ORDINARY)
  if (myAgent.isConnected()) {
    // send search_file message to super peer
    // wait for search_response message
    if msg.isSuccess() {
      // get ID of peer with file from payload
      // send request_file message to peer
      // wait for file_response message from peer
      // (receiving the file response message simulated file transfer)
      finished = true;
    }
  }

SEND FILE (SUPER, ORDINARY)
  // receive request_file message from peer
  // send file_response message to peer

RECEIVE CONNECTION (SUPER)
  // receive request_connection message
  if (myAgent.peerList().size() < myAgent.maxPeers()) {
    // send connection_response success
    // add peer to peerList()
  else {
    // send connection_response fail message
  }

RECEIVE FILE LIST (SUPER)
  // receive files_list message
  // store peer and the list of files
  //

SUPER PEER BEHAVIOUR
* 


PEER STATES
* Waiting for peers
* Connecting to peers
* Sending file list (ORDINARY)

NORMAL PEER BEHAVIOURS

REGISTER
* Ask Host Cache to join network.

ASK FOR PEERS
* Ask Host Cache for Peers.
* Mark as "Waiting for peers".

RECEIVE SUPER PEERS BEHAVIOUR
* Nothing unless "Waiting for peers".
* Receive a message with list of Super Peers
* Remember this list.
* Mark as "Waiting for connection"

CONNECT TO PEER BEHAVIOUR
* 

* Ask one of the Super Peers given earlier if we can connect. Mark as "Wait for connection request response"
* Receive a ConnectionResponseFailure message. Remove that peer from the list. Mark as "Waiting for connection".
* List of Super Peers is empty.  
* Receive a ConnectionResponseSuccess message. Mark as "Waiting for peers"
